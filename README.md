# Joka

I'm currently mentoring one of my good friends (nickname Joka). He's got zero experience with programming and this year he's starting a 2 year course on Analysis and Development of Systems.

The programming classes will be lectured in C, so that's the language I decided to mentor him on. This repository will list the exercices and programs we do together.
